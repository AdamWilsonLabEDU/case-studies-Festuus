# Introduction to problem/question

The Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) is a migratory bird species with a broad distribution across North America. My project will explore seasonal trends in Osprey occurrences across the United States by comparing the geographic distribution and timing of sightings in Flickr photos with data from eBird. The primary goal is to assess whether trends in the presence and migration patterns of Ospreys, as seen in Flickr images, match the patterns from eBird observations. By doing so, the project seeks to provide insight into the correlation between photo-based citizen science data, as well as to highlight how social media platforms like Flickr can contribute to ecological studies.

# Problem / Question
Can we crowd-source the presence/absence data of a bird species from social media data?

# Inspiring Examples

##Example1
![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0048969719323095-ga1_lrg.jpg)
This article used social media data, mined from Flickr and Twitter, geolocated in Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) to assess i) patterns of popularity; ii) relationships of this popularity with geographical and biological variables; and iii) identify sites under high pressure from visitors. I selected this example as it uses the same data source, Flickr, as I propose to use for my project.

## Example 2

Similarly, citizen science projects contributed to the shortfall in data for biodiversity monitoring and promoted public stewardship of nature in Tropical Biodiversity Area. The authors document and analyse BigMonth2020, a month-long birdwatching event across Java and Bali, publicised through social media and incentivised with grants and competitions.

## Example 3

Here, the authors evaluated the potential of social media as a citizen science data source for bird-window collision (BWC), They collected BWC data on social media Facebook as well as Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network (TaiRON), the main dedicated citizen science platform for reporting wildlife mortalities in Taiwan. The authors then compared a decade of BWC data (2012–2022) from the two platforms by examining the nationwide geographical coverage and the species compositions of the BWC observations. This project is a relevant example of how social media data has been used to explore ecological understandings.



# Proposed data sources

Flickr Photos: Flickr’s public API will be used to gather geotagged images of Ospreys from across the U.S. by querying hashtags such as "#Osprey" and related keywords.
Timeframe: Images will be filtered by date to analyze seasonal trends.
API Documentation: Flickr API


eBird Data: eBird’s occurrence and observation data will be accessed through their data portal, focusing on Osprey sightings across the U.S. The data will include location, date, and number of birds observed.
API Documentation: eBird API

# Proposed methods

Data Collection:
Use the Flickr API to collect images tagged with "Osprey" and related keywords. Download metadata including location, date, and time of posting.
Use the eBird API to gather occurrence data for Ospreys across the U.S., filtering by date range to match the temporal scope of the Flickr data.

Data Preprocessing:
Clean and standardize both datasets (Flickr and eBird) to ensure consistency in location formats (e.g., converting geocoordinates to the same projection) and time intervals.
Handle any missing or incomplete data from both sources by imputing values or filtering out incomplete records.

Data Integration:
Combine the datasets (Flickr and eBird) based on geographic location and time (seasonal patterns) to compare Osprey occurrences.
Create a spatial analysis using R packages like sf for spatial data handling and dplyr for data manipulation.

Visualization:
Use ggplot2 for initial seasonal trend visualizations (e.g., month-by-month comparison of Flickr sightings vs. eBird observations).
Create an interactive map with leaflet to visualize geographic patterns of Osprey sightings based on both data sources.
Generate a heatmap to compare Osprey presence across the U.S. by season, using both the Flickr and eBird datasets.

# Expected results

A set maps showing the geographic distribution of Osprey sightings over time, comparing the patterns in Flickr photos with eBird data.
Seasonal trend graphs that demonstrate the timing of Osprey presence across the U.S. based on both data sources, highlighting any matching patterns or discrepancies.
A final report summarizing findings, with a focus on identifying migration trends and any correlation between photo-based data and formal bird observation data.
